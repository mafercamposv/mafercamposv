## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**mafercamposv/mafercamposv** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
Hi Iâ€™m Mafer!
I am studying Genomic Sciences in UNAM. Iâ€™m currently learning german, because I'm really intesreted in epigenetics and immunology and I find that some ofthe reserach there is really exciting. I think itâ€™s wonderful how related this two aspects are, and all the valuable information there is still to discover to create new technologies that can help humans . Iâ€™m also interested in bacteria and gene editing. Iâ€™m motivated by the possibility of a future  where technologies are widely available and our quality of life in our species improves, as well as for the rest of the living organisms on earth. I think bioinformatics coupled with biochemistry, is one of the tools that will help us understand nature and develop important technologies in the following years.
I learned about Genomics by watching the CRISPR documentary when i was a teen, Ever since then, I`ve been very passionate about the subject and IÂ´m a huge admirer of Dr. Jennifer Doudna, who won the Nobel Prize a few years ago.
