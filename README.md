## Hi there 👋

Hi I’m Mafer!
I am studying Genomic Sciences in UNAM 🧬. I’m currently learning german, because I'm really intesreted in epigenetics and immunology and I find that some ofthe reserach there is really exciting. I think it’s wonderful how related this two aspects are, and all the valuable information there is still to discover to create new technologies that can help humans . I’m also interested in bacteria and gene editing. I’m motivated by the possibility of a future  where technologies are widely available and our quality of life in our species improves, as well as for the rest of the living organisms on earth. I think bioinformatics coupled with biochemistry, is one of the tools that will help us understand nature and develop important technologies in the following years.
I learned about Genomics by watching the CRISPR documentary when i was a teen, Ever since then, I`ve been very passionate about the subject and I´m a huge admirer of Dr. Jennifer Doudna, who won the Nobel Prize a few years ago.
